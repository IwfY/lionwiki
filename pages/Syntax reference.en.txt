This document explains all syntax features of core LionWiki. Syntax of tables (provided by plugin) is on separate page: [Tables plugin].

!Headings;
Example:
{{!Heading H2
!!Heading H3
!!!Heading H4}}

{html}
!Heading H2
!!Heading H3
!!!Heading H4{/html}
!Heading H2

!!Heading H3

!!!Heading H4

More exclamation marks you use, smaller heading is (up to 5 exclamation marks). This is different from WiKiss (possibly also TigerWiki), ! is used for H2, because H1 should be reserved for title. Exclamation marks has to be exactly at the start of the line.

!Text styles
^''^'Bold^''^' --> '''Bold''' (three apostrophes)
^''Italic^'' --> ''Italic'' (two apostrophes)
^''^''^'Bold and italic^''^''^' --> '''''Bold and italic''''' (five apostrophes)
^'--Strikethrough--' --> '--Strikethrough--'
^'__Underlined__' --> '__Underlined__'
!!Since LionWiki 2.0
^{small}Small text^{/small} --> {small}Small text{/small}
2^{sup}10^{/sup} --> x{sup}10{/sup}
x^{sub}i^{/sub} --> x{sub}i{/sub}

!Emails, links, images
Links to other pages can be created like this:
^[Main page] -> [Main page]

or 

^[Main project page|Main page] -> [Main project page|Main page]
{br}
Emails and web links are automatically recognized:

^http://lionwiki.0o.cz -> http://lionwiki.0o.cz
lionwiki^@example.com -> lionwiki@example.com
{br}
If you want to have different link and link text, you can use following syntax:
^[LionWiki|^http://lionwiki.0o.cz] -> [LionWiki|http://lionwiki.0o.cz]
{br}
You can use also relative links, but they have to start with ./ (otherwise it will be interpreted as Wiki page)
So if you want to link some HTML page in the same directory, you use:

^[Interesting page|./SomeWebPage.html] -> [Interesting page|./SomeWebPage.html]
{br}
One bonus feature is link to article on Wikipedia of your language:
^[?Albert Einstein] -> [?Albert Einstein]

!!Images
LionWiki does not have built-in support for uploading images. However, Upload plugin is in standard LionWiki distribution, so you should have it. It's accessible through [this link|./?action=upload]. If you don't have it installed you can still upload images manually.

^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg] --> [http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg]

You can use your image as your link: ^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/] --> 
[http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|http://lionwiki.0o.cz/]

You can also place your image to the left or right, possibly combined with link feature:
[http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|left] [http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|http://lionwiki.0o.cz/|right]
<-- ^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|left]
^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/|right] -->

!Subpages
''This feature is available since LionWiki 2.0.''

Subpages are useful when you need to insert some common content into multiple pages. Example could be list of available language versions of some page - you would probably want to insert this into every language variant. That's ok, but what happens when you want to add one more language variant? You have to update list in all other language variants. Subpage mechanism solves this problem by creating page which contains this list and including this page into all the variants with special keyword. Then, if you want to add one language variant, you need to add it to just one page. Another useful application could be Menu displayed on every page.

Including page is done with keyword ^{include:page_to_be_included}.

You can use the same syntax to include page in template (i.e. not in page content), but in this case, whole content of this subpage must be in HTML (you can, but not have to enclose it in ^{html} and ^{/html}).

!Multilingual content
''This feature is available since LionWiki 2.0.''
Let's say you have page named "Biography" in German and you would like to make French variant. Rename page Biography to Biography.de and create page named Biography.fr and insert French translation there. Then visitors whose browser identifies primary language as French will see Biography.fr. It's recommended to create a redirect from page Biography to default language variant. The obvious limitation is that page name has to stay the same in every language variant. That's not such a big problem with "Biography", but it can be worse with other names. 

This is recommended way to create multilingual content, there are more ways to do it.

Useful feature to maintain multilingual content is Subpage mechanism, which is described in previous section or PageVersions plugin (insert ^{VERSIONS} in the content and plugin will automatically detect and display all language variants of current page).

!Redirects
''This feature is available since LionWiki 2.0.''
If you want to redirect from some page to other, put ^{redirect:page} at the very beginning of the page. It's not straightforward to edit page containing redirect because every visit will cause redirecting. The only way to edit such page is from search results (as it provides direct edit links), or possibly by manually altering URL.

!Other
!!Characters
Some sequences of characters are automatically replaced:
* Arrows : <^-- : <--, ^--> : -->, <^--> : <-->
* Dash : ^-- : -- (since LionWiki 2.0)
* Copyrights : ^(c) or ^(C) : (c), ^(r) or ^(R) : (r)

!!Code
Code syntax is useful when you need to keep original spacing and layout of text, especially for programming source code.

^{{import sys
if len(sys.argv) == 2:
   print "Hello",sys.argv^[1]}}
does:
{{import sys
if len(sys.argv) == 2:
   print "Hello",sys.argv[1]}}

!!Horizontal line
----
by '''^--^--'''

!!Suppressing wiki syntax
By using ^^ character before syntax keyword or using ^{{something}}. If you still don't know how, take a look on wiki code of this page, there are plenty of examples. If you want to insert ^^ character, you have to double it, i.e. ^^^^

!!HTML code
Do you want to insert youtube video to your site? Or any other HTML code? Just insert it between ^{html}some html code{/html}. This feature is potentially dangerous so there's option to turn it off in config file ($NO_HTML = true).

{html}<object width="217" height="177"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OvZrhdy2UdY&amp;hl=cs&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OvZrhdy2UdY&amp;hl=cs&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="217" height="177"></embed></object>{/html}

!!!HTML entities
''Since LionWiki 2.0''. HTML entities are automatically recognized and left without modification. 

!!Newline
LionWiki joins adjacent newlines together, if you need more than one newline, use ^{br}.

!!Internal comments
''Since LionWiki 2.0''. You can insert internal comments not intended to be displayed using HTML-like syntax ^<!^-- text not intended to be displayed ^-->
